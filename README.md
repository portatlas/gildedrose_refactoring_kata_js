# Project Title

Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata in JavaScript

## About

This was an excercise to refactor existing code with JavaScript. Apart from the requirements, there were no clear instructions and test were not provided. I started by writing the test, refactoring the code, and then add additional feature requirements.

## Running the tests

The tests were written in Jasmine.

To run the test:
Open the SpecRunner.html file in a browser
